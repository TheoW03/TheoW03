> As of 8/28/2025 all of my personal repositories have been migrated to [Code berg](https://codeberg.org/TheoW03). where Iâ€™ll continue hosting, maintaining, and collaborating on my work.

## My reasoning

While GitHub has been considered the industry standard for years, 
I wanted to explore a more community-driven alternative that emphasizes transparency, privacy, and open-source principles. 
Codeberg offers a welcoming environment for collaboration, where projects can thrive without the influence of corporate interests. 
Its nonprofit structure and focus on ethical stewardship provide a space where developers can work openly and responsibly. 
Moving my projects there allows me to participate in a community that values openness, accessibility, and long-term sustainability, which aligns with the principles I want to support in my work.

I will however keep my account to report issues of software I use. but for software I work on, I will be using codeberg.
