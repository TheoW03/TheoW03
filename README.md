I want to learn more about webdev and Systems level programming. C/C++. also want to try game modding. and maybe the unitity framework.

what Im doing to acheieve this is I downloaded codeblocks for C/C++ and Game modding I downloaded Forge and the mode framework
trying to figure out how to set it up but Ill get it. 

Im also very passionate with programming and CS. to the point it can be problematic.
