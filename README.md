pronouns: He/him

I am a 2nd year university student, Computer Science Major  

I enjoy watching anime, gaming, hanging out with friends, and of course I love to program.

I know how to program in Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Java, C# 

I been doing alot of gamedev on Unity, and I love it. 

some math.  that I learned and will love to share. 

e^(i*pi) = -1
e^(i*2pi) = 1

proof for this is. because e^i rotates 
90 degrees on the complex plain + the cirlce constants e^(i * mutiple of pi) will act like 
the cosine op. so e^(i *  mutiple of pi) = cos(mutilple of pi)
